# CounterRank
> ### CounterRank

**CounterRank**:

  * The ranking of counters is kept in memory.

  * Every time a counter is incremented, the ranking has to be updated too.

  * Different counters may have the same value, hence, they will share the
    same ranking.

  * The leaders are the counters at first place.

The exercise consists to implement the `CounterRank.API` behaviour in the best
possible way, keeping in mind the expected worst case complexity. You will find
more details in `CounterRank.API` module.
